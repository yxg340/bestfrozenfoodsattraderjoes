	<p>The ranking you came here to look for is here!!!!!!!!
Without further ado, here it is:  </p>

	<h1>#5: Vegetable Panang Curry</h1>
	<p>Aside from the lack of spice, this bowl was one of my favorites ... the rice comes out fluffy, there are a ton of veggies, and it's vegan, so the creamy sauce won't weigh you down.</p>

	<h1>#4: Mushroom and Black Truffle Flatbread</h1>
	<p>The flatbreads without a doubt take down the pizzas, as proven by this UNREAL mushroom truffle number. It's a true struggle to not add one of these to my cart every time I shop at TJâ€™s.</p>

	<h1>#3: Pepperoni Pizza Mac and Cheese Bowl</h1>
	<p>Pizza mac and cheese is everything you could want on an especially bad day. This was my favorite of the mac and cheeses, although those who don't like pepperoni were obviously partial to the more traditional bowls.</p>

	<h1>#2:Riced Cauliflower Bowl</h1>
	<p>Pizza mac and cheese is everything you could want on an especially bad day. This was my favorite of the mac and cheeses, although those who don't like pepperoni were obviously partial to the more traditional bowls.</p>

	<h1>#1: Chicken Tikka Masala</h1>
	<p>Coming in first place ... chicken tikka masala! It's truly the gold star of frozen food, and as good, if not better than, any take-out meal you could order. Plus, it's ready in less than five minutes. If you haven't tried it yet, prepare to be obsessed.</p>
