	  	<p>Chicken Chow Mein!!! Pair it with some frozen broccoli and chopped red bell pepper for the ultimate Chinese food takeout experience! It takes a little longer than the directions suggest to heat through but it’s worth the wait!! The sauce is amazing and super authentic!</p>

	  	<p>A huge bag of deliciousness stuffed with meats and vegetables !!! This one literally stands out from the other Chinese food options with the best consistency and overall taste. Meat does not taste frozen. Pair it with rice and you are good to go!Definitely a better value than takeout!!!</p>

	  	<p>Where to even begin with this one! A dish and side dish all in one! I could eat this over and over again and never get tired of it. The taste brings me back to India. The only downside is the poor portion! Double it in size and I’ll stock up. Pair it with your favorite greens, whatever works. </p>

	 	<img src="resources/chipotle.png">
	  	<p>It is time to say goodbye to Chipotle or whatever Mexican fast food chain that’s near you. This chicken burrito bowl has everything you would expect in a normal one. The only downside is the chicken tastes a little dry. Other than that, the nutritious combination of beans, veggies and meats is probably the reason why it is always out of stock. You really don’t need to pair it with anything, just put in microwave for three minutes and you’re all set. </p>
